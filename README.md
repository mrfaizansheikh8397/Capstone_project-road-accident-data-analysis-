# Capstone_project-road-accident-data-analysis-
This project focuses on analyzing road accident data in India between 2003 and 2016. India has the highest number of road fatalities in the world.
India accounted for more than a third of global road accident deaths. The World Health Organization says such deaths are under-reported and estimated that in 2016, the figure for India was likely twice as big as that reported by the government.
In this project, perform a detailed statistical data analysis on Road Accidents of India over a period of 2003 to 2016 years using various Python Libraries.

Data Sources
The data used in this analysis comes from various reports on road accidents in India and is spread across several CSV files:

roadAccStats13-16.csv: Road accident statistics from 2013 to 2016.
Details_of_road_accident_deaths_by_situation_state_2014.csv: Data on road accident deaths by situation and state for 2014.
Persons_killed_due_to_Non-use_of_Safety_Device_2016.csv: Statistics on deaths due to non-use of safety devices like helmets in 2016.
Additional data files covering reasons for accidents, lanes, and vehicle types.
Each dataset focuses on different aspects of road accidents, such as offenders' gender, time of accidents, reasons, and number of lanes.

Setup Instructions
Run the analysis in Jupyter notebook.

Analysis Questions
This project answers the following questions:

What is the percentage of road accidents over the years?
What is the mean number of accidents per 1L population for each year?
Which state has the highest and lowest number of road accidents?
How do gender dynamics influence offenders and victims in road accidents?
What percentage of deaths occur due to non-wearing of helmets between males and females? ...
The full list of questions is addressed through statistical and graphical analysis.

Results & Insights
Some key findings from the analysis:

Road accidents showed an increasing trend from 2003 to 2016, with a peak in [year].
States like [State A] reported the highest number of accidents, while [State B] had the lowest.
Non-wearing of helmets significantly contributed to deaths, especially among males.
Accidents tend to be higher during nighttime and on single-lane roads.
Additional insights are documented within the project notebooks.
